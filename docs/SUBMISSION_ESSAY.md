Growing up in Mexico means growing up with earthquakes. Mexico sits at the convergence of three tectonic plates -- the North American, the Cocos, and the Pacific -- making it one of the most seismically active countries on Earth. More than 12,000 earthquakes are recorded in Mexico every single year. On September 19, 2017, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Puebla, killing 370 people, collapsing 44 buildings in Mexico City alone, and leaving an entire nation in shock. That date is seared into the collective memory of every Mexican.

After every earthquake, the same conversation happens: people realize they did not know what to do. They froze. They ran outside when they should have dropped and taken cover. They did not have water, a flashlight, or a family meeting point. The knowledge existed -- on government websites, in pamphlets nobody reads -- but it never reached people in a way that stuck. I built EarthReady MX to change that.

**EarthReady MX** is an immersive earthquake preparedness app that transforms passive learning into a multisensory simulation experience. Instead of reading bullet points about what to do during an earthquake, users hear a seismic alert, feel the ground shake through haptic feedback, and make split-second decisions under a ticking countdown -- just like a real earthquake. The app follows a deliberate pedagogical cycle: **Learn, Test, Act**. Users first study what to do before, during, and after an earthquake. Then they face five illustrated emergency scenarios -- a shaking classroom, a gas leak in an apartment, a collapsing street -- where they must choose the correct response within 15 seconds. Finally, based on their performance, the app guides them through a 34-item preparedness checklist sourced directly from FEMA Ready.gov and CENAPRED (Mexico's National Center for Disaster Prevention). This cycle closes the gap between knowing and doing. It is not enough to learn what an emergency kit should contain; EarthReady MX walks you through building one.

The technical decisions behind this app were driven by a single constraint: everything must be self-contained. The entire project is a Swift App Playground with 15 source files, approximately 3,900 lines of code, and less than one megabyte in size. There are zero external dependencies, zero bundled images, and zero audio files.

Every illustration in the app -- classrooms with swinging lamps, apartments with gas flames, streets with crumbling buildings -- is built entirely with SF Symbols and SwiftUI shapes. This was a deliberate choice: SF Symbols scale beautifully across devices, support Dynamic Type, and adapt to accessibility settings automatically.

The audio system was the most challenging and rewarding part of the project. I built a real-time audio synthesis engine using `AVAudioEngine` and `AVAudioSourceNode` with a four-oscillator architecture. The splash screen reproduces the distinctive alternating tones (950 Hz and 1200 Hz) of SASMEX, Mexico's Seismic Alert System -- a sound that every Mexican recognizes but few people outside the country have ever heard. SASMEX is one of only a handful of public earthquake early warning systems in the world, and reproducing its alert tone programmatically connects the app to a deeply meaningful cultural reference. During the simulation, sub-bass oscillators and noise generators create a visceral earthquake rumble. Correct and incorrect answers trigger distinct synthesized tones. The celebration sound adapts to the user's score. All of this is generated in real time through mathematical waveforms -- sine waves, noise functions, frequency modulation -- without a single audio file.

CoreHaptics adds another sensory layer with six distinct haptic patterns. During the earthquake simulation, the haptic intensity gradually increases, mirroring the crescendo of a real seismic event. Success and failure responses have their own tactile signatures, and a celebration pattern rewards perfect scores. These haptics transform the experience from something you watch into something you feel.

Accessibility was not an afterthought -- it was foundational. Every interactive element has VoiceOver labels, hints, and traits. Screen transitions trigger accessibility announcements so blind users always know where they are. The app fully supports Reduce Motion: when enabled, animations are replaced with immediate content display, and decorative particle effects are hidden. Decorative elements are properly marked so assistive technologies skip them. I wanted every person, regardless of ability, to be able to prepare for an earthquake.

The preparedness checklist represents the social impact core of the app. Its 34 items are organized into three categories -- Emergency Kit, Home Safety, and Family Plan -- with three priority levels: Critical, Important, and Recommended. Every single item comes from official guidelines published by FEMA and CENAPRED. This is not generic advice; it is the same guidance that emergency management professionals use. Items like "store one gallon of water per person per day for three days" and "designate a family meeting point outside your home" are concrete, actionable steps that could genuinely save lives.

Building EarthReady MX taught me that the hardest part of creating technology for social good is not the code -- it is understanding the problem deeply enough to design a solution that people will actually use. I learned how to synthesize audio from mathematical first principles, how to design haptic patterns that convey physical sensations, how to make accessibility a structural feature rather than a checklist item, and how to translate official disaster preparedness guidelines into an interactive experience that respects the gravity of the subject while keeping users engaged.

In Mexico, we say "no estamos preparados, pero somos solidarios" -- we are not prepared, but we are united. EarthReady MX is my attempt to make us both.
